# Project-02

<!-- PSA: Remember to install packages youâ€™re requiring in your code and test before you push to develop or submit a pull request to main. It will make development faster and easier :) -->

<!-- ISSUES -->

<!-- API
- how are we using the api?
- what data are we able to pull from google maps and how will we be able to manipulate it?
- can we seed location data with google maps api to prevent writing unnecessary seed information + save a ton of time?
- can we seed public restroom data with google maps api? (this would save a lot of time)
- is there just a public restrooms api or a different, better api we could use that'd be easier for us to work with?
- can we have this figured out and coded by saturday?? It will be hard to code the rest of the project without this data

SEED INFO
- this will also be time consuming if we can't figure out how to access the location or restroom data from a third party api
- seed files need to be converted to js files and completed with information enough to present multiple locations and reviews
- we need to figure out exactly what information we need from each model, why + how we're using it, where we need to send it, etc.

BACK END FINISHED AND WORKING BEFORE SAT CLASS IS THE NECESSARY GOAL
*if not, we will only have one class period to complete: handlebars, styling, front end js AND the presentation - this is not enough time.

*** AFTER BACK END, WE STILL HAVE :
- many many handlebars files (+ connect them to wherever they need to be connected to)
- html and css (*styling is time consuming* + forms, 'update' and 'post' routes, event listeners, big huge javascript functions to iterate through all of our api calls ** which can only be like 75 calls per hour or something like that ** )
- front end javascript (this will have to do a lot for us in terms of functionality, this will be a lot of work and take A LOT of time)
- deploy to Heroku
- figure out how to access it and present it from Heroku
- readme

- presentation
    - slides
    - timing
    - meeting presentation requirements

**This alone will be tough to reach by due date - not including favorites, pinboards, user customization optiions like themes, light/dark switch, etc -->

<!-- ** If we don't have the time to make this happen, we need to sit down and figure out what we can make happen and how - we shouldn't wait till Sat to start figuring this out - we don't have time ** -->

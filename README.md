## Description

The Loo Review
---USER STORY---
As a user I want to be able to quickly find a bathroom in an given area. I would also like the ability to rate a restroom and see other user reviews.

This application allows users to find a restroom in there area and see all previous reviews with the timestamps either before or after the user visits the restroom. The user can then also choose to leave a review of thier own as well as add a business to the ever growing list.

# Project-02

<!-- TEAM DASHBOARD
    * please enter your name to pick up issues as you start each one
    * will help track pace and progress + get you tons of commits on github ;)
    * task timeline at bottom -->

<!-- ISSUES --
<!-- Total: 30 --           * consider how long each problem will take you to solve
<!-- Per Person: 7 --       * understand that more issues will arise as we continue to develop
<!-- Per Day: 1 --              * each issue you solve will reduce the amount of time the next issue will take you
<!-- Days left: 7 --        * you can do this in 7 days-->
<!--                        * you can do this for 7 days-->




<!-- PSA: Remember to install packages youâ€™re requiring in your code and test before you push to develop or submit a pull request to main. It will make development much faster and easier :) -->

<!-- PSA: Comment your code and use console.logs for testing + leave them in there so others who are using that page can test as well. We will delete them before we submit -->

<!-- House Keeping:
    - When you start up the server, what does the 'Executing (default): SELECT 1+1 AS result' message mean?
    - Note: userRoutes and homeRoutes are almost complete, but didn't have enough time to test
        - to update the develop branch for others to use:
            - git checkout develop
            - git pull origin yourbranchname
            - git commit
            - git push (pushes your branch changes that you just pulled into develop)
            - git checkout yourbranchname + continue working. rinse + repeat

        - don't send pull req to main unless code has been tested and is working correctly
        -->

<!-- Dependecies:
    - bcrypt 5.0.1- installed, not working properly
    - dotenv 8.2.0- installed, questions about .env file when repo being pushed and pulled
    - express 4.17.1- installed, working
    - express-handlebars 5.3.0 - installed, not initiated
    - mysql2 2.2.5 - installed, *handles promises differently than 'mysql'
    - nodemon - installed, cuts out development time bc you're not always stopping and starting server. run: nodemon server.js
    - sequelize 6.6.2 - installed, working so far
    - uniqid 5.3.0 - installed, *use to manage assigning unique ids if needed, uninstall if not-->

<!--
X - API /* pick up issue: { Brandon } */
- how are we using the api?
- what data are we able to pull from google maps and how will we be able to manipulate it?
    - * figure out how to remedy the git guardian secret thing // save for last

SEED INFO
    *this will also be time consuming if we can't figure out how to access the location or restroom data from a third party api

X - seed files need to be converted to js files and completed with information enough to present multiple locations and reviews /* pick up issue: { Janee' } */
#1 - we need to figure out exactly what information we need from each model, why + how we're using it, where we need to send it, etc. /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
        - where is it all coming from and going to??
        - why??

* categories removed from MVP due to accessive api calls and time consuming logic /

BCRYPT NOT WORKING
    *password encryption is going to be difficult
#2 - commented out in user.js to get server running - there is a bug /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
    - boilerplate passport

BACK END FINISHED AND WORKING BEFORE TUES CLASS IS THE NECESSARY GOAL
*if not, we will only have one class period to complete: handlebars, styling, front end js AND the presentation - this is not enough time.

*** AFTER BACK END, WE STILL HAVE :
#3, #4 - many many handlebars files (+ connect them to wherever they need to be connected to)
    /* pick up issue: { Brandon } */
    /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
        * home.hbs(login), loos.hbs(render loos within 20 mi radius *haversine* ), map.hbs (map view and form to leave review)
#5, #6 CSS for handlebars files
        /* pick up issue: { Janee'} */
        /* pick up issue: {  } */
    #7  - style main.handlebars
    #8  - style other views ** code class and id names to be resusable for all these pages to minimize work + time

*** PLUS:
#9 - forms /* pick up issue: {  } */
#10 - event listeners /* pick up issue: {  } */
#11 - big huge javascript functions to iterate through all of our api calls /* pick up issue: {  } */
        * api calls can only be up to 75 per hour or something like that ** )

*** front end javascript (this will have to do a lot for us in terms of functionality, this will be a lot of work and take A LOT of time)

#12 - main menu functionality - modal with buttons/links /* pick up issue: {  } */
    * search functionality not needed - haversine function to render 20 mi radius based on user's current location
#13 - rating functionality *front end js /* pick up issue: {  } */
#14 - event listeners for each button /* pick up issue: {  } */
[#15, #16, #17]
    {- probably more stuff
    - assuming at least 3 problems that take forever to solve
    - slowing us down *fill in as they arise* }
#18 - favorites and trip boards/saved // save for last
#19 - deploy to Heroku /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
#20 - figure out how to access it from Heroku /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
#21 - present it /* pick up issue: {  } */
#22 - readme /* pick up issue: {  } */

- presentation /* pick up issue: {  } */
#23 - slides
#24 - timing
#25 - meet presentation requirements

**This alone will be tough to reach by due date - not including **
#26 - favorites + pinboards
#27 - user customization optiions like themes, light/dark switch, etc /* pick up issue: {  } */ -->

<!-- ** If we don't have the time to make this happen,
    we need to sit down and figure out what we can make happen
    and how we can present something we're proud of + will get us
    jobs with lots of money - we shouldn't wait till Sat to start figuring this out - we don't have time ** -->


<!-- PAGES + ROUTES
    - login redirects to homepage
    - homepage renders loodata (haversine - 20 mi radius) + map (view buttons render selected loo + reviews)
        - add new loo in menu - modal form
    - selected loo + reviews hbs (loo: id + reviews for that loo)
        - new review button - modal form

    - api routes

        - map.hbs: map view - location pinpoints clickable to render "selected loo modal" which will scroll down to reviews
            * at top of reviews there will be a button to leave a review and modal form to leave review.
            - on map.hbs there will be a button to add new loo w pop up modal form to add a new loo
                - this will redirect to "selected loo modal" rendering the loo that was just added
    - -->

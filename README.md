<!-- TEAM DASHBOARD
    * please enter your name to pick up issues as you start each one
    * will help track pace and progress + get you tons of commits on github ;)
    * task timeline at bottom -->

<!-- ISSUES --
<!-- Total: 20 --           * consider how long each problem will take you to solve
<!-- Per Person: 5 --       * understand that more issues will arise as we continue to develop
<!-- Per Day: 0.625 --      * each issue you solve will reduce the amount of time the next issue will take you
<!-- Days left: 8 --        * you can do this in 8 days-->
<!--                        * you can do this for 8 days-->




<!-- PSA: Remember to install packages youâ€™re requiring in your code and test before you push to develop or submit a pull request to main. It will make development much faster and easier :) -->

<!-- API /* pick up issue: {  } */
- how are we using the api?
- what data are we able to pull from google maps and how will we be able to manipulate it?
- can we seed location data with google maps api to prevent writing unnecessary seed information + save a ton of time?
- can we seed public restroom data with google maps api? (this would save a lot of time)
- is there just a public restrooms api or a different, better api we could use that'd be easier for us to work with?
- can we have this figured out and coded by saturday?? It will be hard to code the rest of the project without this data

SEED INFO
- this will also be time consuming if we can't figure out how to access the location or restroom data from a third party api
- seed files need to be converted to js files and completed with information enough to present multiple locations and reviews /* pick up issue: {  } */
- we need to figure out exactly what information we need from each model, why + how we're using it, where we need to send it, etc. /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - where is it all coming from and going to??
    - why??
* categories removed from MVP due to accessive api calls and time consuming logic

BCRYPT NOT WORKING
- commented out in user.js to get server running - there is a bug /* pick up issue: {  } */
-

BACK END FINISHED AND WORKING BEFORE SAT CLASS IS THE NECESSARY GOAL
*if not, we will only have one class period to complete: handlebars, styling, front end js AND the presentation - this is not enough time.

*** AFTER BACK END, WE STILL HAVE :
- many many handlebars files (+ connect them to wherever they need to be connected to) /* pick up issue: {  } */ /* pick up issue: {  } */
- html and css /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - style main.handlebars
    - style other views - code class and id names to be resusable for all these pages to minimize work + time
    - style index.html
- PLUS:
    - forms /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - event listeners /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - big huge javascript functions to iterate through all of our api calls /* pick up issue: {  } */
        * api calls can only be up to 75 per hour or something like that ** )
- front end javascript (this will have to do a lot for us in terms of functionality, this will be a lot of work and take A LOT of time)
    - search bar funcitonality /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - main menu functionality /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - rating functionality /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - event listeners for each button /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - probably more stuff
    - favorites and trip boards/saved // save for last
- deploy to Heroku /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
- figure out how to access it from Heroku /* pick up issue: { Kathryn } */
- present it /* pick up issue: {  } */
- readme /* pick up issue: {  } */

- presentation /* pick up issue: {  } */
    - slides
    - timing
    - meeting presentation requirements

**This alone will be tough to reach by due date - not including **
- favorites + pinboards
- user customization optiions like themes, light/dark switch, etc /* pick up issue: {  } */ -->

<!-- ** If we don't have the time to make this happen,
    we need to sit down and figure out what we can make happen
    and how we can present something we're proud of + will get us
    jobs with lots of money - we shouldn't wait till Sat to start figuring this out - we don't have time ** -->

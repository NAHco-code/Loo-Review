# Project-02

<!-- ISSUES -->

<!-- API
- how are we using the api?
- what data are we able to pull from google maps and how will we be able to manipulate it?
- can we seed location data with google maps api?
- can we seed bathroom data with google maps api? (this would save a lot of time)

SEED INFO
- this will also be time consuming
- seed files need to converted to js files and completed with information enough to present multiple locations and reviews

BACK END FINISHED AND WORKING BEFORE SAT CLASS
*if not, we will only have one class period to work on handlebars, styling, front end js AND the presentation - this is not enough time. PLEASE find time to dedicate to working on this project outside of class time.

* after back end, we still have -
- many many handlebars files (+ connect them)
- html and css (styling is time consuming + forms, update, post routes, event listeners)
- front end javascript (this will have to do a lot, this will be a lot of work and take A LOT of time)
- deploy to Heroku
- readme

- presentation
    - slides
    - timing
    - meeting presentation requirements



This alone will be tough to reach by due date - not including favorites, pinboards, user customization optiions like themes, light/dark switch, etc -->

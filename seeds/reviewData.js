        review: "So, I sit down, relax, and pull out my phone. I'm scrolling through the latest news, allowing nature to run it's course (so to speak), living in sweet euphoric bliss. I've just submit a subpar words with friends retailiation when I reach back and freeze in terror. To my horror, there was no toilet paper.. anywhere. No paper napkins, no hand towel, nothing. I won't tell you how the story ends because I'd like for you to retain your innocence. Heed my warning sweet summer child. Come bearing TP if you're going to use this facility.",

        review: "Two of the sinks were out of order so I had to wait to wash my hands. This was problematic because even though I waited, I saw several people exit without washing their hands. Be very afraid.",

        review: "This bathroom is awesome! When you first walk in there are several doors in a row, kind of like stalls. Inside each stall is a small mini bathroom, complete with individual sinks. It was really nice and fancy. The facility seemed to be well stalked and clean. ",

The toilet itself is silver and reflective. The ceiling light is an extravagant chandelier. I can appreciate the finer things in life but this is next level. It's a pass from me poo pourri!",

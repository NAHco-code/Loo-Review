This rig can take anything you can throw at it. No log too long; no poo too plump. Comfort? It's like the seat was made for my buttcheeks. Excellent light for hours of optimum phone scrolling. This is my gift to you my fellow poo enthusiasts. Sit back, relax, and let the good times roll."

The smell was something akin to that one time my dog threw up. In emergency, you gotta do what you gotta do - but if I were you, I'd find the nearest bush instead."
